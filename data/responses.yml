  utter_sales_bill_discounting:
    - text: |
        Sales Bill Discounting initiated by MSMEs (sellers) enables faster payment cycles by allowing 
        them to sell their receivables (invoices) to a financial institution at a discounted rate. This helps MSMEs 
        receive immediate cash instead of waiting for payment from large buyers (anchors), who typically take 
        longer payment terms (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 days). The seller bears the associated costs. This solution 
        enhances cash flow for MSMEs, providing quick liquidity while streamlining the payment process. 

  utter_purchase_bill_discounting:
    - text: |
        Purchase Bill Discounting: Enables buyers to pay suppliers early. Financer pays supplier; buyer repays on due date. Optimizes working capital.

  utter_vendor_finance:
    - text: |
        Vendor Finance: Financial support for your suppliers, ensuring a healthy and stable supply chain.
        Vendor Finance is a finance solution where suppliers (vendors) offer unsecured funding to 
        buyers (often through a lender-approved program) to help them purchase goods or 
        services without immediate full payment. In this arrangement, the supplier acts as the 
        borrower, supported by trade confirmations from the buyer (Anchor), who may or may not 
        provide a guarantee. This enables suppliers to access credit lines, deferred payment 
        plans, or loans, facilitating smoother business-to-business (B2B) transactions while 
        improving cash flow and enabling buyers to make purchases on favourable terms.

  utter_dealer_finance:
    - text: |
        Dealer Finance: Support for your dealer network to manage inventory and sales, boosting your business.
        Dealer Finance provides unsecured financing to dealers, enabling them to procure goods from 
        Anchors (suppliers) without immediate full payment. In this arrangement, dealers act as borrowers, and 
        the Anchor may optionally serve as a guarantor, depending on the terms of the financing. This solution 
        supports dealers, such as those selling cars or machinery, by offering flexible payment options—either 
        through in-house financing or third-party lenders—helping them secure inventory and meet customer 
        demand while managing their cash flow. 
  utter_early_payment_finance:
    - text: |
        Early Payment Finance: Accelerates payments in your supply chain, optimizing working capital for you and your partners.
        Early Payment Finance is a supply chain finance program offered by the 
        Anchor/Distributor/Seller to encourage their retailers/buyers to pay their invoices ahead of 
        the due date. Also known as Early Payment Discount, this program incentivizes buyers to 
        settle invoices before their due date in exchange for attractive discounts. 

  utter_lease_rental_discounting:
