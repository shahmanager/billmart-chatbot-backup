  utter_vendor_finance_info:

      **Vendor Finance** is a solution where suppliers (vendors) can get unsecured funding to help buyers purchase goods without immediate full payment. The supplier acts as the borrower, supported by trade confirmations from the buyer (Anchor). This improves cash flow and facilitates smoother B2B transactions.
  utter_vendor_finance_process:
  - text: |
      Here is how Vendor Finance works:
      1. A Buyer (Anchor) sends a purchase order to the Supplier (Vendor).

      3. The Buyer requests funding from a financer based on the accepted invoice.
      4. The financer validates the transaction and disburses the funds directly to the Supplier's account.

  utter_faq_vendor_finance_what_is:
  - text: |-
      Vendor Finance is a financing solution where a supplier offers funding to help buyers purchase goods or services without paying the full amount upfront.
      This is often done through a lender-approved program. In this setup-
      The supplier acts as the borrower.
      The buyer (also called the Anchor) confirms the trade and may or may not provide a guarantee.
      It allows suppliers to access credit or deferred payment plans, helping improve cash flow and making B2B transactions smoother. Buyers also benefit by being able to buy on more flexible, favourable terms. Would you like to know more about how it works or the benefits it offers?

  utter_sales_bill_discounting:
  - text: |
      Sales Bill Discounting initiated by MSMEs (sellers) enables faster payment cycles by allowing 
      them to sell their receivables (invoices) to a financial institution at a discounted rate. This helps MSMEs 
      receive immediate cash instead of waiting for payment from large buyers (anchors), who typically take 
      longer payment terms (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 days). The seller bears the associated costs. This solution 
      enhances cash flow for MSMEs, providing quick liquidity while streamlining the payment process. 
  utter_purchase_bill_discounting:
  - text: |
      Purchase Bill Discounting: Enables buyers to pay suppliers early. Financer pays supplier; buyer repays on due date. Optimizes working capital.
  utter_vendor_finance:
  - text: |
      Vendor Finance: Financial support for your suppliers, ensuring a healthy and stable supply chain.
      Vendor Finance is a finance solution where suppliers (vendors) offer unsecured funding to 
      buyers (often through a lender-approved program) to help them purchase goods or 
      services without immediate full payment. In this arrangement, the supplier acts as the 
      borrower, supported by trade confirmations from the buyer (Anchor), who may or may not 
      provide a guarantee. This enables suppliers to access credit lines, deferred payment 
      plans, or loans, facilitating smoother business-to-business (B2B) transactions while 
      improving cash flow and enabling buyers to make purchases on favourable terms.
  utter_dealer_finance:
  - text: |
      Dealer Finance: Support for your dealer network to manage inventory and sales, boosting your business.
      Dealer Finance provides unsecured financing to dealers, enabling them to procure goods from 
      Anchors (suppliers) without immediate full payment. In this arrangement, dealers act as borrowers, and 
      the Anchor may optionally serve as a guarantor, depending on the terms of the financing. This solution 
      supports dealers, such as those selling cars or machinery, by offering flexible payment options‚Äîeither 
      through in-house financing or third-party lenders‚Äîhelping them secure inventory and meet customer 
      demand while managing their cash flow. 
  utter_early_payment_finance:
  - text: |
      Early Payment Finance: Accelerates payments in your supply chain, optimizing working capital for you and your partners.
